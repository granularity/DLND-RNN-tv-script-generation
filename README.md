# TV script generation | RNN

### Train a neural network on TV scripts from The Simpson's to generate a new script using recurrent neural networks (RNN) and long short term memory (LSTM) cells. 

This is the third project in Udacity's [Deep Learning Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101). The program covers topics like Keras and TensorFlow, convolutional and recurrent networks, deep reinforcement learning, and GANs. 

In this project, I was able to generate a new Simpsons' script, a scene at Moe's Tavern, based on existing script data using recurrent neural networks (RNN).
